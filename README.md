## Valuation & Analyst Outlook

**Consensus:** Strong Buy  
**Avg. 12-month price target:** $189.56  
**Range:** $135 – $250

**Valuation Approaches:**
- Comparable Company Analysis – High premium due to growth & margins
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) – Even with moderated growth, intrinsic value supports a large portion of current market cap

---

## Challenges & Risks

- **Sustaining Growth** – Long-term slowdown risk
- **Geopolitical Tensions** – e.g., 15% revenue share deal for China export licenses
- **Competition** – Huawei & CSP in-house solutions
- **High Valuation** – Vulnerable to sentiment shifts

---

## Conclusion

NVIDIA is a **technological titan** leading the AI-driven future. Financial strength and market position are unmatched, but valuation is stretched. Execution over the next few years will determine if it can maintain growth and justify expectations.
